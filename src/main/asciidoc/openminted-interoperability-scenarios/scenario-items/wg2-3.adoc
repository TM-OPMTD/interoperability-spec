=== Scenario 3 -- The relation between documents and knowledge bases through keywords

==== What is the scenario:

The general idea is to treat keywords attached to a publication as a "mini lexicon" representing its topic and
expand/enrich this lexicon by combining it with lexical/conceptual resources such as domain lexica, glossaries and
ontologies. Possible applications of this idea:

* A user wants to find publications on a specific research topic. The query terms can be mapped to a resource consisting
of keywords & their synonyms/hypernyms/semantically linked words/phrases as encoded in other lexical resources.
* The use of multilingual lexica in this scenario can also lead to the identification of publications on the same
research topic in various languages; especially important when keywords in all these publications are not direct
translation equivalents of each other, but linked through other semantically similar words/phrases/concepts
* Document clustering based on keywords can also be enhanced through the expansion of keywords with semantically
related words from lexical resources and ontologies.

WG2 specific tasks: KB content harmonization including semantic mapping and multilingual keyword expansion.

==== Why is the scenario relevant to the WG:

It involves the interoperability between various language resources (publications, lexical resources, ontologies etc.).

==== Why is the scenario relevant to the other WGs:

* WG1: identifying resources of different types on the same topic / of the same domain
* WG3: ensuring that the automatic access to the various resources is allowed; the combined use of resources makes the
scenario more complicated as one needs to ensure that all resources allow their exploitation
* WG4: creating workflows for the use cases, taking care of the fact that different types of resources can be used at
various stages of the process and thus need to be interoperable (ensuring appropriate input and output)

==== Why is the scenario relevant to external experts:

Interoperability issues between resources of the same or different type (e.g. lexica, keywords, term banks) is a central
topic. Combining this with document search extends resource coverage

==== How could OpenMinTeD / the WGs address it:

* WG1 & WG2 (each WG focusing on their area but interacting for similar/linked features):
** annotating sections with relevant information inside the document/publication
** relevant metadata included in the resource description (e.g. domain, keywords, â€¦)
** exploiting existing and finding appropriate ways of linking and mapping concepts as represented in publications,
lexica, ontologies etc.
* WG3:
** representing terms of use in a machine readable format
** ensuring that interaction between multiple resources is allowed when required only if there are no conflicts between
the terms of use
* WG4:
** indicating appropriate input & output formats for resources involved in the workflow;
** discussing the architecture of appropriate processes and workflows (e.g. how and when the various resources should
be accessed)


==== What kind of feedback could we expect from other WGs / external experts for that scenario:

* Ascertain that indeed it is worth exploiting
* Discuss interoperability issues between the various types of resources (texts, lexica, ontologies etc.), especially
with regard to the architecture of relevant workflows, and suggest appropriate ways of tackling them.

==== Possible requirements/interoperability recommendations

Keywords should be in some way qualified with the source of the keyword if it belongs to a controlled vocabulary. E.g.
a keyword could be a URI or there could be an additional metadata field indicating where keywords come from
(latter related to WG1).
