=== Scenario 2 -- Including Custom Knowledge

==== Description:

A user wants to analyze mentions of pharmaceutical products based on the main agents used in these products. The user
uses a publicly accessible dataset of products and their agents, but the dataset is incomplete, e.g. does not include
products still in testing stage. The user wants to provide additional (confidential/unlicensed/proprietary) data about
product/agents that should be taken into account for the analysis.

WG2 specific tasks:

* KB content harmonization including semantic mapping
* harmonization of I/O specifications for TDM workflows
* harmonization of output format

==== Relevance to the WG:

Use-case involves a public and a custom/private knowledge source

==== Relevance to other WGs:

* WG1: Not particularly relevant
* WG3: because the custom knowledge source may be confidential
* WG4: because the custom knowledge source may not be accessible

==== Relevance in general:

Including custom content and/or confidential data is a common problem in infrastructures

==== Approaches:

* WG 2
** indicate if this is a real world problem
** suggest how knowledge can be managed/packaged/harmonized.
* WG 3
** indicate if there are legal/contractual devices to cater for confidentiality and/or use of an unlicensed resource transiently during processing (assuming that the user trusts the platform in the first place)
** safe-harbor provisions?
* WG 4
** allow deployment of TDM analytics in an environment trusted by the user
** allow the TDM platform to access resources provided by a user
** allow user to include excerpts (potentially anonymized, e.g. product/agent names replaces with IDs) of resources along with input data for TDM

==== Open questions:

* indicate if this is a real world problem
* suggest how knowledge can be managed/packaged
* report how such problems have been addressed (if at all)
