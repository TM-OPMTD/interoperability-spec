=== Scenario 1 -- Transferability of components between ecosystems

==== What is the scenario

I am building a text mining workflow in a specific workflow editor (e.g. Argo).
There is a really useful component, but it is in a repository for a different workflow editor (say GATE).
I cannot use this really useful Gate workflow (which may be made of one or more modules) in my Argo workflow.
I must either reimplement the really useful component in Argo or convert the work I have already done into Gate.

==== Why is the scenario relevant to the WG

This scenario exposes the core issue in workflow interoperability. Because different workflow editors use differing
annotation schema, a component written for one workflow ties the user into that specific ecosystem.  This has a direct
negative impact on the scientific goals of openness and reproducibility.

==== Why is the scenario relevant to the other WGs

* Resource MetaData (WG1): A key form of metadata is the input and output of each tool. Standardisation of this metadata
would lead to greater interoperability between tools.
* Language Resources (WG2): Annotations produced by a specific component may be inaccessible to alternate components due
to the annotation scheme in use. Also, workflows which are built in a specific workflow editor will not be usable within
other workflow editors.
* IPR and licensing (WG3): Less relevant. Licensing issues may affect which services can be combined. May also affect the
usage of the workflowâ€™s results if an incorporated component has a stricter licensing policy.


==== Why is the scenario relevant to external experts

External experts will want a smooth experience when using a TDM framework. Having to reimplement components is
frustrating and costs time and money.

==== How could OpenMinTeD / the WGs address it

* Common annotation formats and annotation schemes between components.
* Workflows as web services with the ability to incorporate web services into workflows.
* Building a grand unified text annotation workflow editor (and getting everybody to use it) or facilitating the
embedding of components from one ecosystem in the workflow of another one, cf. GATE-UIMA bridge such that users of
ecosystems that already exist for the respective frameworks can continue to work in their known environment while still
profiting from components previously out of reach.

==== What kind of feedback could we expect from other WGs / external experts for that scenario

* Experiences of being constrained to a specific ecosystem
* Requirements for the integration of a set of incompatible components.
* Estimation of the cost to their business of having to reimplement a component / workflow.
* Experiences of actual benefits of reimplementing a component / workflow.
