The component metadata should be provided in such a way that it is separable from the component.
I.e. despite the canonical source of much of the metadata being the source code (and in a second
instance, the compiled code), it should not be necessary to inspect the source code (or compiled
code) to access the metadata or to actually invoke the component. Instead, the component should be
accompanied by a metadata file that was automatically generated during build time. Component
repositories for example should use this file when looking for component metadata. The file should
be at a well-known location within the component artifact.

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.

| using uimaFIT to automatically generate UIMA XML descriptors. XML descriptors as always next to
the respective component classes. Pointers to all XML descriptors as stored in at
`META-INF/org.apache.uima.fit/components.txt` within the respective JAR files. Maven POM
files are also embedded in the JARs under `META-INF/maven/.../pom.xml`.

| only for those components that still use CREOLE descriptors and do *not* use CREOLE Java annotations. It is, however, trivial to produce separate versions as GATE contains an ANT task to write CREOLE descriptors to disk from the Java annotations and it would be trivial to add this to the build process of each plugin.
