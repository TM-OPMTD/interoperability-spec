Using such a widely adopted naming convention assists component developers through familiarity and helps avoid naming collisions due to the use of use domain names, under the control of the developers, as part of the identifier.  It is also the recommended method of identifying components in existing text mining systems such as Argo and GATE.

| ARGO/U-Compare
| partial
| All of our current components are identified by strings that follow the Java fully-qualified class naming convention, however as the component identifier within Argo is derived from a filepath it is entirely possible for this requirement to be broken by new components.  For example, the UIMA descriptor for the Argo component Chemical Entity Recogniser has the path `/desc/uk/ac/nactem/uima/ChemicalEntityRecogniser.xml` which translates into the identifier `uk.ac.nactem.uima.ChemicalEntityRecogniser`.
