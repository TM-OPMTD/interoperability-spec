Components in systems such as alvis offer several parameters used to configure the behavior of the component execution. In order to help users understand a specific parameter and its role, the parameters should be well identified and described. The descriptions should contain information to help users understand how and in what context a parameter is used, and also provide the data types (e.g., boolean, integer, string) accepted by a parameter.

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.
