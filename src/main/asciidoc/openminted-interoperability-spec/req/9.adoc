A workflow execution system will need to know which annotation schemas to load when running a component within a workflow.  Not having this information would result in the system having to load all of the annotation schemas it knows about at runtime for each component or force the workflow creators to manually specify them, both highly inefficient options.  This information also forms part of the components documentation, assisting workflow creators.

| Components live within Maven artifacts. These declare dependencies on other Maven artifacts which contain the type system definitions. Most component declare input and output types. Thus, the XML type system descriptors for a component can be obtained by scanning the Maven dependencies for XML type descriptors that declare types which are used as input/output types by a given component.
