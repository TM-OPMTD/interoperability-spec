A workflow execution system will need to know which annotation schemas to load when running a component within a workflow.  Not having this information would result in the system having to load all of the annotation schemas it knows about at runtime for each component or force the workflow creators to manually specify them, both highly inefficient options.  This information also forms part of the components documentation, assisting workflow creators.

| Argo components must declare the type systems they depend upon within their UIMA descriptor file.

| DKPro Core
| Partial
| Components live within Maven artifacts. These declare dependencies on other Maven artifacts which contain the type system definitions. Most component declare input and output types. Thus, the XML type system descriptors for a component can be obtained by scanning the Maven dependencies for XML type descriptors that declare types which are used as input/output types by a given component.

| GATE
| Partial
| GATE does not enforce any type system and as such does not require components to declare in any way their input/output types. That being said it does support XML schemas for defining annotations (and their features) and so it would be possible to bundle a set of schemas with a component (i.e. within the JAR file) that defined the expected input/output annotations. For example, the ANNIE plugin already comes with schemas which define the main NE annotations produced by the application (GATE's terminology for a workflow). We also have a component, the Schema Enforcer, that can be used to ensure that the output of an application strictly conforms to a given set of schemas removing any annotations or features not defined by the schemas. The manual annotation aspects of GATE Developer can also be configured to only allow annotations/features defined by XML schemas to be created.

| UIMA components declare the type system they depend upon within their descriptor file. The type system is a Maven dependency of all readers, analyzers and exporters. Components declare input and output types.
