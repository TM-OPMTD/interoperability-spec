With a large number of components, it can be difficult for workflow creators to find the most appropriate components if they can only search for components by name or by reading each component's documentation.  Having components associated with categories would enable workflow creators to easily search for a particular type of component (e.g. part-of-speech tagger) as well as allowing associated UI tooling an additional way of ordering lists of components on-screen.

| DKPro Core components try to follow a naming scheme, e.g. `XxxReader`, `XxxWriter`, `XxxSegmenter`, `XxxPosTagger`, etc. Categories can be derived off these names in many cases. In some cases, components fulfill multiple purposes, e.g. TreeTagger does lemmatization and POS tagging. A second source off which category information could be derived are the input/output types declared by the components, e.g. `Sentence`, `Token`, etc. There is no direct associated with any (external) categorization system.
