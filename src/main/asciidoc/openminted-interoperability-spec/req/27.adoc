In the event that a component fails (e.g. due to a loss in network connectivity when writing to a database), then the component should ensure that there are no side-effects (e.g. database in an inconsistent state) which prevent the component from being re-ran at a later date, from the same point as which it failed.  This would be required if the execution platform were to offer checkpointing.

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.

| DKPro Core
| N/A
| DKPro Core does not provide any workflow functionality. It relies on such functionality to be provided by a workflow engine. Components are usually implemented fail-fast: as soon as a problem occurs, an exception is thrown. How the workflow engine (or application embedding DKPro Core components) handles these is up to them.
