In the event that a component fails (e.g. due to a loss in network connectivity when writing to a database), then the component should ensure that there are no side-effects (e.g. database in an inconsistent state) which prevent the component from being re-ran at a later date, from the same point as which it failed.  This would be required if the execution platform were to offer checkpointing.

// Below is an example of how a compliance evaluation table could look. This is presently optional
// and may be moved to a more structured/principled format later maintained in separate files.
