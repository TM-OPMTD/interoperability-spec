Whenever possible, components should allow to incorporate multiple resources in parallel, e.g. looking up a word from multiple sources or using multiple classification models in parallel. Exampes:

    Stanford CoreNLP named entity recognizer can load multiple NER models in parallel
    a Gazeteer should be able to access not only a single knowledge resources, but be able to access e.g. multiple SparQL endpoints

Components may choose or have to disambiguate results if there are multiple hits, e.g. using a relevance or confidence score, in particular if the annotation scheme being used does not allow for multiple categories to be assigned to a single element (e.g. a Named Entity) or does not allow multiple elements to exist at the same location.

Another alternative would be to add the same component multiple times to a workflow, each time using a different resources - this would require that at least temporarily multiple categories/annotation elements would be allowed. A subsequent component could be used to select the most relevant one(s).

Caveat: Having relevance/confidence scores from different sources bears a great risk of the scores being on different scales and not comparable.

Note: parallel access to resources could be externalized into a resource adapter, such that the component itself would not have to deal explicitly with handling multiple adapters in parallel.
