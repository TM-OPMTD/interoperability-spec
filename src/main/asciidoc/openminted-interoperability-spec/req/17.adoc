To enable scaling of components, using networked machines, it should be recommended that a component avoids any form of local state with regards to the processing of a document.  

Note: If a component is required to be stateful, it would make sense for the platform to offer a solution to allow scaling of stateful components.

| GATE components are all Java beans. This means that the document to process is provided to the component via a set method making it part of the state of the component. Multiple instances of a component can of course be created to enable processing of multiple documents in parallel. Naively creating multiple instances should, however, be avoided as this is wasteful in terms of memory as it reequires multiple copies of internal state that can be shared. The framework supports inteligent duplication of components and applications to share appropriate state across threads.
