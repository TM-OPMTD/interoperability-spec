In order to incorporate an entire workflow (not only a single component) which may potentially be using a specific workflow engine/implementation or flow configuration that cannot be imported into my workflow editor of choice, it must be possible to treat the whole workflow as a component applying encapsulation and information hiding. However, it includes the ability to configure individual components in the workflow, e.g. by exposing these parameters as workflow parameters.

Note: Relevant approaches are e.g. the UIMA Aggregate Analysis Engines or GATE Applications.

| UIMA
| Full
| UIMA supports the concept of *aggregate analysis engines* whose delegates can be either primitive analysis engines or further aggregate engines. Aggegate engines may declare parameters whose values can be forwarded to delegates.
