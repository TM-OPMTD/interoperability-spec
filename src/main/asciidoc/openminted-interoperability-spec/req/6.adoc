Components should contain an identifier by which they can be distinguished from each other, in addition to their version.  A component registry would then be able to use the combination of the identifier and version number to produce resolvable URLs from which components can be retrieved.

| Alvis
| Partial
| Components (instances of components) are well identified in a workflow but component versioning is not maintained in Alvis.
| draft

| ARGO/U-Compare
| partial
| Each component has a unique id under the `uk.ac.nactem.uima` namespace (derived from the path of the UIMA descriptor file within the component's UIMA PEAR file) and a version number specified within the component's UIMA descriptor file.  Argo doesn't currently support the concept of component versions; it only uses whichever version of the component that was installed last.

| DKPro Core
| partial
| Each component has a unique name under the `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro` namespace (basically a Java class name) and a version. The version of a component corresponds to the version of the JAR that contains the version. Each component is contained in a JAR which has a unique Maven GAVC coordinate (e.g. `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core:de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.opennlp-asl:1.8.0:jar`).

| ILSP
| partial
| Each component has a unique name under the `gr.ilsp.nlp` namespace (basically a Java class name) and a version. The version of a component corresponds to the version of the JAR that contains the version. Each component is contained in a JAR which has a unique Maven GAVC coordinate (e.g. `gr.ilsp.nlp:ilsp-nlp-lemmatizer:1.2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`). We try to use some type of semantic versioning (http://semver.org/) for the components, but for some of them this is not so strictly followed.
