Components should contain an identifier by which they can be distinguished from each other, in addition to their version.  A component registry would then be able to use the combination of the identifier and version number to produce resolvable URLs from which components can be retrieved.

| Each component has a unique name under the `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro` namespace (basically a Java class name) and a version. The version of a component corresponds to the version of the JAR that contains the version. Each component is contained in a JAR which has a unique Maven GAVC coordinate (e.g. `de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core:de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.opennlp-asl:1.8.0:jar`).
