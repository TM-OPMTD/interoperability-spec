Text and Data Mining (TDM) components are not always self-contained entities; for example, a component maybe a wrapper to another library developed in a language not supported by the TDM framework.  This library may have additional system dependencies that must be available at runtime - think of a Java TDM component wrapping a python library; the python library will require Python and potentially other Python libraries.  Knowing the environmental requirements allows a workflow execution system to ensure that they are met before the component is initialised.

| ARGO/U-Compare

| All components are distributed as UIMA PEAR files written in Java, with some components requiring platform-specific binaries.  Platform-specific binaries are provided for OSX, Windows and Linux.  This appears to be the same behaviour as DK Pro.  When running a worklow on a cluster/cloud, Argo requires an expected maximum memory limit per component instance in a workflow, and this is not included in the component's metadata - it has to be entered manually by users.

| All components are in Java, some require platform-specific binaries which are provided usually for Linux, Windows, and OS X in a pre-compiled form. There is no metadata explaining which components rely on binaries or about the supported platforms and OS versions. E.g. some binaries don't work on modern Linuxes (hunpos) others do not work on old versions. The required Java version is available through a property defined in the POM.
