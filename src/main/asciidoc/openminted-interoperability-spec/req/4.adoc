The URL of the actual content, e.g. a text file, PDF file, or other common data format, must be
derivable from readily discoverable data. It must either be included in the metadata or it must
be reliably constructable from the metadata URL, e.g. by appending or changing a suffix. Derivation
rules must be clearly documented.
