It is important that not only is a license strongly assigned to components and resources but that this information is passed upwards through workflows etc. so that a license can be assigned to an agregate or to newly created resources that result.
To this end storing license information within component metadata seems the most sensible way forward.

| DKPro Core
| Partial
| DKPro Core components have license metadata about their own code in their POM hierarchy. It is also available for those dependencies that provide license information in their respective POMs (not all dependencies declare such license information in their POMs). For most models/resources, we currently have no license information.

| GATE
| No
| Currently GATE components do not have a license assigned as part of the metadata. The next version of GATE will use maven for plugin/component distribution and will have access to license information documented in the pom.xml for a plugin.
